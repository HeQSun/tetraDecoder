Befrore running the pipeline, install necessary customized tools, check [INSTALL](https://github.com/HeQSun/tetraDecoder/blob/main/INSTALL).

To start the process, check the [pipeline](https://github.com/HeQSun/tetraDecoder/blob/main/Pipeline.md)

Note, tools required are listed in the beginning of the pipeline. Please install following their instructions.
