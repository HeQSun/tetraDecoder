Here we introduce the pipeline for achieving haplotype-resolved, chromosome-level genome assembly of tetraploids using long read sequencing and HiC sequencing. This is to support the analysis in [Sun_and_Tusso_et_al_2024].

Pipeline of assembly

Befrore running the pipeline, install necessary customized tools, check INSTALL.

To start the process, check the [pipeline](https://github.com/HeQSun/tetraDecoder/tree/main/pipeline)

Note, in the pipeline, there are tools like hifiasm, bowtie2 etc required, which are all publicly available. Please install following their instructions.
